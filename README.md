This project is an example of architecture using new technologies and best practices. The goal is to learn and share knowledge and use it as reference for new projects.

- Clean Code
- SOLID Principles
- Fail Fast Principle

- Result Pattern
- Folder-By-Feature Structure
- Separation of Concerns

## Benefits
- Simple and evolutionary architecture.
- Standardized and centralized flow for validation, log, security, return, etc.
- Avoid cyclical references.
- Avoid unnecessary dependency injection.
- Segregation by feature instead of technical type.
- Single responsibility for each request and response.
